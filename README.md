# Poster generator for the Dropbox Hack Week Haxpo


Requires:
1. `pip install flask`
2. Install the font "Founders Grotesk".  Ask a designer for access to it since sadly it's not free.  (or find it on the internet)

Just run this to see an example.  The data comes from data.tsv which is an export from the haxpo spreadsheet.  The webpage doesn't look very nice in a browser, but the css it uses should should make the the print previews look correct.  My workflow was to run this, try to print it but export it to a PDF.  Do a test print of one page of the PDF, then print the full PDF.
